    <summary><h2>background:</h2></summary>
     <p>I studied physics and mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. It was there that I learned how to use <i>Mathematica</i>, which is a notebook interface environment for working with the Wolfram Language: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>-inspired functional programming language, <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/language/">among other things</a>. I did a software engineering internship with <a href="http://www.business-laboratory.com/">Business Laboratory</a> in Houston, and ended up learning Python and AWS with WL for developing some automated microservices.</p>

<details id="currently">
    <summary><h2>currently:</h2></summary>
    <p>I am in a technical writing position that focuses on product documentation for WL. I help design user workflows for a variety of applications as well as help architect how information is structured, cross-linked, etc. I also help create internal tools to automate our documentation build process.</p>

<details id="nonwork">
    <summary><h2>outside of work:</h2></summary>
    <p>I'd been learning HTML and CSS for a bit and thought I'd check out what else is out there: coming from a background having mostly used a proprietary language, open source and web development intimidated me. But the skills I've learned from work easily transfer over to more standard tooling.</p>

    <p>My housing organization needed help updating their website, so I took up the challenge to learn web development more seriously, and am now spearheading the development process.</p>

<details id="other">
    <summary><h2>do you do anything other than program?</h2></summary>
    <p>Sometimes...</p>

    <p>I'm very involved and interested in cooperative living, I knit a lot, I love Star Wars, and I've been told I'm an excellent cook by my partner's family and my housemates.</p>

    <p>I also just started making my own soap.</p>

    <p>I talk about all these things on my <a href="https://twitter.com/fourierfiend">Twitter</a>.</p>
